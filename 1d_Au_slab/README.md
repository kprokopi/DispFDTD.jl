Calculation of the transmittance through a slab of gold modelled as a Drude-critical point medium. A comparison between FDTD code and the analytical solution is given.  

A new dispersive model for metals has been recently proposed that includes a single Drude term and N critical point pairs . It has been proved in several works that the Drude-critical point (DCP) model can more accurately describe the dielectric dispersion of metals in infrared and optical frequencies than the widely used Drude-Lorentz medium.

The FDTD code is based on the following papers:
